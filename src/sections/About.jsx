        Hi! I'm Jerrod, a solution oriented and efficiency focused software engineer and business owner. My journey began with self-teaching and intensive training, and I now specialize in full-stack development, cloud computing, and building scalable applications.
      </p>
      <p>
        Currently, Iâ€™m focused on building Ravny, my bespoke software solutions company, where I create tailored business applications that enhance security, efficiency, and accountability.
      </p>
      <p>
        When I'm not behind the computer or working with clients, you can probably find me mountain biking, reading, spending time with my kids, or playing my favorite board games!
